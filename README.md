# üì∞üîç News Categorizer 98 üéØ‚ú®

A Machine Learning-powered web app for classifying news articles into five categories: **Sport, Tech, Entertainment, Politics, and Business**. Built with Gradio, this project leverages an SVM classifier trained on BBC News data, using a **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer** for feature extraction, and achieves an impressive **98% accuracy**.

## Features

- üì∞ Classifies news articles into 5 categories
- ‚ö° Fast, interactive web interface (Gradio)
- üßπ Automatic text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword & punctuation removal)
- üìà SVM model with 98% accuracy
- üè∑Ô∏è Label encoding for category mapping
- üì¶ Easy to run locally

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoazEldsouky/News-Classification-with-SVC-Clearly-Explained.git
   cd News-Classification-with-SVC-Clearly-Explained
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download NLTK data (first run only):**
   The app will automatically download required NLTK data (`punkt`, `stopwords`) on first launch.

---

## Usage

Simply run the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will launch a Gradio web interface in your browser. Paste any news article, and the app will predict its category.

## Model Details

- **Algorithm:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Vectorizer:** **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
- **Label Encoder:** Maps predicted class indices to category names
- **Preprocessing:** Lowercasing, tokenization, stopword & punctuation removal (using NLTK)
- **Training Data:** BBC News articles ([see Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/moazeldsokyx/news-classification-with-svc-clearly-explained))
- **Accuracy:** 98%
